We can make adorable candy bouquets for your gift-giving. You can choose four Theater Boxes of candy as the base and have a bouquet of favorite candy bars coming out from it.  Weâ€™ll cover it in cellophane and tie it with a colorful ribbon. We can also make smaller bouquets using Chocolate Roses or Twinkle Pops. Prices vary, depending on the candy chosen. (Please give us 2-hour notice for one and 24-hour notice for additional bouquets.)
