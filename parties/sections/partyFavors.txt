We can do many different types of party favors.  Choose Mix & Match candy to put into a cellophane bag and we’ll tie it with colorful ribbon.  You can add in packaged candy, a lollipop or candy stick to make it more festive.  Or, you can choose a Candy Kabob or Candy Lei as a favor.  For a more adult party, we can do a small box of chocolates, or just a single truffle, depending on your budget. (Please give us 24-hour notice for orders of two or more, depending on the type of favor you’re interested in.)
