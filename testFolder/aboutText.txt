Sweet Street is a family-owned business run by Didi Reed. Didi loves children, and has four of her own. On December 24, 2010, the Reed family bought Sweet Street with the hopes of bringing a fun, child-friendly store to downtown Danville. <br /><br />

Didi and her husband, Billy, are local residents who have lived in the area for over 20 years. Didi has served as PTA President at two local schools, been a School Board Liaison and has also served as the VP of the San Ramon Valley Education Foundation, while Billy has coached both football and basketball. Didi's passion for operating a candy/toy store began when she ran the prize booth at Alamo School for over 10 years.  <br /><br />

When her oldest kids went off to college, she went to work managing a candy store & loved it. Her sweet dream of owning her own candy store has come true - she bought the local candy shop and, with the help of her family and Sweet Street hosts, has created the sweetest place in town. She hopes you'll stop by and leave with a smile on your face. <br /><br />
